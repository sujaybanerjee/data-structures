# data-structures
This repository is from a Middlebury College computer science class in which we studied the ideas and structures helpful in designing algorithms and writing programs for solving large, complex problems. 
The Java programming language and object-oriented paradigm are introduced in the context of important abstract data types (ADTs) such as stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
We studied efficient implementations of these ADTs, and learn classic algorithms to manipulate these structures for tasks such as sorting and searching.
